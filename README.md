# Asteria-2.0
Asteria is an open source Runescape emulator for the #317 protocol that has been in ongoing development since late 2013. This version is no longer being developed. 

Please check out the successor to this project [Luna](https://github.com/lare96/luna), which aims to correct the many mistakes I made throughout the various releases of Asteria.

The only required dependency to build this is [gson-2.2.4](https://github.com/google/gson)
